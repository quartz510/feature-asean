                        <p>Uncontrolled blazes spurred by weather, wind, and dry underbrush, wildfires can burn millions of acres of land at rapid speeds and can consume everything—trees, homes, even humans—in their paths. These rolling flames travel up to 14 miles an hour, which converts to about a four-minute mile pace, and can overtake the average human in minutes.
                        </p>
                        <br/>
                        <h3>How wildfires start</h3>
                        <p>Though they are classified by the Environmental Protection Agency as natural disasters, only ten to 15 percent of wildfires occur on their own in nature. The other 85 to 90 percent result from human causes, including unattended camp and debris fires, discarded cigarettes, and arson.
                            Naturally occurring wildfires can spark during dry weather and droughts. In these conditions, normally green vegetation can convert into bone-dry, flammable fuel; strong winds spread fire quickly; and warm temperatures encourage combustion. With these ingredients, the only thing missing is a spark—in the form of lightning, arson, a downed power line, or a burning campfire or cigarette—to wreak havoc.
                            
                        </p>   
                        <br/>
                        
                        <p>Natural or man-made, three conditions must be present for a wildfire to burn: fuel, oxygen, and a heat source. Firefighters call these three elements the fire triangle.
                            Fuel is any flammable material surrounding a fire, including trees, grasses, brush, even homes. The greater an area's fuel load, the more intense the fire is likely to be. Lightning, burning campfires or cigarettes, and even the sun can all provide sufficient heat to spark a wildfire.                           
                        </p>
