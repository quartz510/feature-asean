                            <p>Living creatures on earth are very diverse. We can even see the difference of living creatures in one species. These differences lead to the biodiversity. According to Priadi (2010:126) biodiversity is a whole variation of living creatures, both form, appearance, number, and nature that can be found at the level of genes, species, or ecosystem levels. </p>
                            <p>According to Mien A. Rifai (2004) The term flora and ecosystem have the following meanings. Flora has two meanings, namely: (1) The whole species of plants on a habitat, area or geological; (2) Works or publications containing the list and the logging of species (types) of vegetation of a particular habitat, region or geological strata. While the ecosystem is the whole formation of living creatures (biomes) and their places of life.</p>
                            <p>Geographically, Indonesia is located on the equator,between the two continents, Asia and Australia; between the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean; and two zoogeographical areas, Orientalis and Australis. Indonesia is also located between two young mountain ranges, Circum-Pacific and Circum-Mediteranian. As a result, Indonesia has so many volcanoes that the land becomes very fertile. Based on the astronomic location, Indonesia is located at 6° NL - 11° SL dan 95° EL - 141° EL, resulting tropical climate with high temperature, which is between 26°C - 28°C and rainfall is about 700-7000 mm per year. This causes the soil to be fertile enough because the rocks weathering process takes place quickly. Its strategic location causes Indonesia to have many variations of abiotic environment and biotic environment. Total land area of Indonesia reaches 2 million km2 and the sea area reaches 6 million km2, causing Indonesia to have at least 42 different ecosystems and included in one of the areas of mega biodiversity because it has biodiversity Very large. Indonesia has 17% of bird species, 16% amphibians and reptiles, 12% of mammals and 10% of all species in the earth. Some of them are endemic because they exist only in the territory of Indonesia and are not found in any other region of the world. Examples include Rafflesia arnoldi and Amorphophallus titanum or known as carcasses, Anoa, Komodo dragons, Maleo birds, and bird of paradise. There are several factors that can cause a country to be referred to as a megabiodiversity area such as regions located in the equator, tropical or subtropical climates, having at least 5.000 endemic types of plants and has many Forest.</p>
